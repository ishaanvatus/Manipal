# MULTIPLEXERS, COMPARATORS AND CODE CONVERTERS 
## Lab Exercises 
1. Write behavioral Verilog code for a 4 to 1 multiplexer using the if-else statement.   
2. Write behavioral Verilog code for an 8 to 1 multiplexer using case statement. Use this 
along with a 2 to 1 multiplexer to write the hierarchical code for a 16 to 1 multiplexer. 
3. Design a 3-bit comparator using only logic gates. Write behavioral Verilog code to 
simulate the design. 
4. Using for loop, write behavioral Verilog code to convert an N bit grey code into 
equivalent binary code.  
 
## Additional Exercises 
1. Write Verilog code to perform BCD to excess-3 code conversion. Use K-map to derive the 
simplified expressions for excess-3 code.  
2. Write and simulate the Verilog code for a 4-bit comparator using 2-bit comparators.
