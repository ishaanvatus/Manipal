# DECODERS AND ENCODERS
## Lab Exercises 
1. Write behavioral Verilog code for a 2 to 4 decoder with active-high enable input and active high output using the if-else statement.  
2. Using the 2 to 4 decoders designed in Q1 above, design a 4 to 16 decoder with active-high enable input and active high output and write the Verilog code for the same. 
3. Write behavioral Verilog code for a 4 to 2 priority encoder using casex statement. 
4. Write behavioral Verilog code for 16 to 4 priority encoder using for loop.  
 
## Additional Exercises 
1. Write behavioral Verilog code for a 2 to 4 decoder with active-high enable input and active high output using case statement. Using the 2 to 4 decoders above, design a 4 to 16 decoder with active-low enable input and active high output and write the Verilog code for the same. 
2. Write behavioral Verilog code for a 3 to 8 decoder with active-high enable input and active low output using the if-else statement. Using 3 to 8 decoders and a 2 to 4 decoder, design a 5 to 32 decoder with active-high enable input and active low output and write the Verilog code for the same.
