# Introduction to Verilog and K-Map 
## Lab Exercises 
1. Simplify the following functions using K-map and implement the circuit using logic gates. 


    a)  f(A,B,C,D) =  ∑m (2,3,6,7,9,10,11,13,14,15) 


    b) f(A,B,C,D) = ∑m(2,4,5,6,10) + D(12,13,14,15) 
2. Simplify the following functions using K-map and implement the circuit using logic gates. 


    a) f(A,B,C,D) =  ∏M(0,1,4,8,9,12,15) 


    b) f(A,B,C,D) = ∏M(2,5,6,8,10) + D(9,12,14) 
 
## Additional Exercises 
1. Write Verilog code to describe the following functions  


    - f1 = ac’+ bc + b’c’ 


    - f2 = (a + b’ + c)(a + b + c’)(a’ + b + c’) 
    Check whether f1 and f2 in question 1 are functionally equivalent or not. 

2. Simulate a circuit that has four inputs, x1, x2, x3, and x4, which produces an output value of 1 whenever three or more of the input variables have the value 1; otherwise, the output has to be
