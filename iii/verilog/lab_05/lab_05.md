# MULTIPLEXER AND DECODER APPLICATIONS
## Lab Exercises
1. Implement the expression F(A,B,C,D)=∑m (0,1,2,4,6,9,12,14) using 4:1 multiplexer and
write the Verilog code for the same.
2. Write Verilog code to convert 4-bit gray code to binary code using 8:1 multiplexers.
3. Implement the function, F(a, b, c, d) = Σm (1,4,6,8,9,13,15) using a 4 to 16 binary
decoder and an OR gate.
4. Write Verilog code to implement 3 input majority function using 2 to 4 decoders and
other necessary gates.
## Additional Exercises
1. Design and write the Verilog code for a BCD to 2421 code converter using 4 to 1
multiplexers and other necessary gates.
2. Design and implement a full adder using 2 to 4 decoder(s) and other gates.
