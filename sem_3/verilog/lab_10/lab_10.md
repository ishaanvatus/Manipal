# COUNTERS  WITH NON-BINARY SEQUENCE 
## Lab Exercises
1. Design a counter with the following repeated binary sequence:  0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7. Use JK flip-flops.  
2. Derive the expressions for the design of a counter with the following repeated binary sequence:  1, 2, 3, 0, 7, 6, 5. Use SR flip-flops. 
3. Design a counter with T flip‚Äêflops that goes through the following binary repeated sequence: 0, 1, 3, 7, 6, 4.
